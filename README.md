# My Typescript Solutions of Leetcode Problems

## AI Usage Policy

AI was not utilized in any capacity for problem-solvingâ€”neither in hint mode nor for code generation. All problem-solving functions are entirely my own code. However, AI was employed for secondary tasks, such as generating unit tests and writing comments for each function.
